# SignSafety

Make sure to use the code in althaaf branch

Run all nodes from within ````signsafety_ws```` using ````ros2 launch driver_pkg multi_node.py````

Add dataset folder into ````signsafety_ws/data```` to and run ````python3 src/recognition_pkg/scripts/allmodels.py```` to generate models

As always, remember to source after building using ````source install/local_setup.bash```` to resolve errors
